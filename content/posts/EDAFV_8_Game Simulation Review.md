#### Simulation Game Learning Goals

* Develop leadership, teamwork, and interpersonal skills.
* Promote better decision making by learning to manage a totally integrated company, including the management of sales outlets, marketing, production, and human and financial resources.
* Facilitate learning of important business concepts, principles, and ways of thinking.

* Have you learned to respond to unforeseen circumstances in a business environment?
* Have you developed an integrated perspective of business?
* Have you learned to work outside of the box or outside of your comfort zone?



### Review of Q1-Q4 Analysis

(See PPT)

#### Q1

* Proposed company name:
* Strategy Statement:
* Target city based on demand
* Annual revenues from 100% market share in that city:(assume average selling price=price-willing-to-pay) 
* Cost in materials + production to build your product: Assume the cost is Rec=...., Mtn=.....and Speed=....... 
* Estimated profit per bicycle sold: (Price-cost=profit)
    * Assume for this exercise that there are no marketing, sales or support costs


#### Q2

* The simulation game gives you hands-on and real-time practice applying strategy tools in a competitive industry
* The Q2 test market will give you competitive data and results so you can analyze your market share, competitive position and pricing, performance and advantage (profitability) and adjust your business decisions to improve or fine-tune in Q3.
* You can calculate industry, segment and city average profitability and see if after Q2 you are above or below average profitability.

#### Q3
* The simulation game gives you hands-on and real-time practice applying strategy tools in a competitive industry
* In Q3 you need to interpret the strategic graphs to • analyze your competitor’s strengths and weaknesses
    * identify best practices to follow
    * add new products and technologies
    * shift sales offices, support/training priorities, incentives for productivity 
    * capture unmet needs and growth opportunities.
* You will take a look at your cash flow and pro forma financial reports to know if you can implement your strategic pivots and adjustments.

#### Q5
* In Q4, competitive positions and advantage can shift dramatically.
* Just like clues in an escape room game, each company team needs to analyze a combination of factors to understand, pivot and adjust dynamically to these shifts.
* Every quarter provides new competitive opportunities and threats— for example, Avatar wins back its leadership from Thumbprint by Q5.

## Class 8 Details

### Overview of the Week
Topic: This is a game simulation review session and preparation for the final executive board presentation and report.

We have covered a strategy toolkit and learned to apply industry analysis—five forces, competitive advantage, value chain, industry life stages and evolution, and finally, blue ocean or value innovation strategy. As a helpful self review, you can fill out the table attached at the end of this outline.(class 3/class 5)

Simulation Game Discussion—We’ll review the key learning goals of the simulation game, note the decisions and takeaways from Q1-Q4 and see how well you can analyze a sample game with the competitive analysis skills you’ve developed. We will discuss the plusses and minuses of the Strategy Simulation Game as you’ve experienced them. I will provide my perspective on how it compares to real-life start-up environments from my experience over the years as board director, corporate venture capitalist or advisory board member of more than fifty tech startups in Silicon Valley.

Executive Board Presentation--Finally, we will provide some guidelines for your Final Executive Board Presentation. In the final class session, you’ll experience presenting and discussing your company’s competitive and market performance highlights and lowlights to your primary investor and executive board of director’s chairperson—myself—as well as getting an inside perspective on the teams that you competed with in your Virtual World. In the handout, I have provided a grading rubric for showing the criteria used to evaluate the different sections of the report and presentation.

### Couese Approach

We will take the following approach to practice our entrepreneurial strategic thinking skills as we go through the game simulation in this course:
1. KNOW how and when to use the firm-level and industry-level analytical tools and frameworks.
2. THINK and be comfortable with the strategy frameworks in action, by seeing the step-by step process of applying strategy analysis to a range of real-life company and industry cases. You’ll be surprised to find that once you have a strategic framework or conceptual “lens”, that you will develop a more intuitive point-of-view on companies and industries you find interesting and worth following in the business press.
3. SPEAK and share your strategic thinking, analysis, relevant experience and insights in our discussion-based online forums, synchronous sessions and in influencing your Simulation Game team decision-making.
4. ACT and practice applying competitive advantage, value chain, industry stages of evolution and blue ocean value innovation to new company and industry cases, as well to your simulation game executive decision-making.

As a framework, consider keeping a comparison chart like the following to remind you about the (a) companies and (b)industries covered, (c) what you found most useful about the strategy tool, (d) what your takeaways were and (e) when you should use this tool.
