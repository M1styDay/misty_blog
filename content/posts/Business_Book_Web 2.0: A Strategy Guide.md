# Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide

## Chapter 1 Users Create Value

### Flickr and Collective User Value

- What is Web2.0

  Web 2.0 turbocharges network effects because online users are no longer limited by how many things they can find, see, or down- load off the Web, but rather by how many things they can do, interact, combine, remix, upload, change, and customize for them- selves. This online DIY self-expression benefits businesses and other users, not just individual uploaders. 
  

- business strategy: Freemium

  Give your service away for free, possibly ad supported but maybe not, acquire a lot of customers very efficiently through word of mouth, referral networks, organic search marketing, etc., then offer premium priced value added services or an enhanced version of your service to your customer base.

### Six Ways Flickr Created User Value Through Interaction

- Open Up Digital Content to Global User Interaction

  This type of shared digital content sets off a positive direct net- work effect on the breadth and variety of the image database and sparks viral marketing. Each new member adds his uploaded digital photos to the completely user-generated collective Flickr photo database rather than maintaining (or hoarding) a proprietary cache of private photos. Of course, Flickr has given users the choice of sharing their photos openly while maintaining control over licensing and ownership. Almost 130 million photos have been posted by some 3 million registered users. Open photo sharing enables Flickr to be a completely user-generated image database. Clearly, this is the same route that YouTube took a few years later but with a slightly different target: a user-generated video database and open community for online public sharing.

- Create Better Search Through User-Generated Information

  The job of tags isn’t to organize all the world’s information into tidy categories. It’s to add value to the giant piles of data that are already out there.

- Discover and Explore Through Online Groups

  Flickr was a leader in creating photo image metadata to make it easier to filter and search through its open photo database and also in encouraging millions of photographers to explore, and dis- cover, through groups. Some of the collective value comes from Flickr leveraging the aggregated number of photos and tags and then dynamically analyzing usage and user behavior in its system to provide improved services, such as “search” or clusters, for users who contribute their photos to the Flickr database. Also, Flickr users gather around particular interests, many of them related to travel, and participate in groups and group events.

- DIY Self-Service Syndication
- Encourage Others to Become Part of Your Digital Ecosystem

### Why Sharing Can Be Profitable

- How does Flickr capture value, and how can it be measured?

  Business managers inside a company can analyze their internal business model to characterize and visually diagram a company’s profit engine. 
  Industry analysts or strategists evaluating a company from the outside can compare it with competitors and industry players to assess its stock market capitalization value, acquisition value, or total enterprise value. They can use industry structural analysis and consumer-focused financial valuation.

- Companies have four choices of how to use revenue streams

	- Single Stream
	- Multiple Streams
	- Interdependent Streams
	- Loss Leader

- the six kinds of revenue models

	- Subscription/membership revenue model
	- Advertising-based revenue model
	- Transaction fee revenue model
	- Volume or unit-based revenue model
	- Licensing and syndication revenue model
	- Sponsorship/co-marketing revenue model, also called revenue- sharing model

### Flickr's Cost Drivers

What are the largest cost drivers, and are they fixed, semi- variable, variable, or nonrecurring? 
How will the cost drivers change over time, by unit volume and by number of customers and usage?

## Chapter 2 Networks Multiply Effects

### Web-Enabled Online Network Effects

Web-enabled online networks have generated several new types of positive network effects. They combine the powerful economic characteristics of digital economics—high upfront costs but negligible incremental costs—with the opportunities of exponential network growth in users and usage, as well as willingness to pay. When increases in usage create more value across all users, a rise in returns is generated that alters the nature of the competition substantially. Achieving critical mass offers the potential for exponential growth, as we saw with Flickr in the previous chapter.

There are different kinds of network effects

* Direct network effects 
    * The value of a good or service increases as more people use it. Each new customer boosts the value of the network and often increases the willingness of all participants to pay for net- work services. The fax machine is a classic example of direct network effects because the first buyer of a fax machine finds it useless with no one to fax, but as his network of users expands, so does the value of having a machine. 
  
* Indirect network effects 
    * More usage of the product spawns the production of increasingly valuable complementary goods, resulting in added value to the original product or service. For example, although some direct network effects are associated with Windows and file compatibility, the indirect network effects that arise from the increased quality and availability of complementary applications software are more significant. 
  
* Cross-network effects (sometimes referred to as two-sided net- work effects) 
    * A rise in usage by one group of users can increase the value of a complementary product or service to another distinct group of users. Hardware and software platforms, reader/writer software pairs, marketplaces, and matching services display this kind of network effect. 
  
* Social network effects (sometimes referred to as local network effects) 
    * Instant messaging shows local network effects. A user is influenced directly by the decisions of a typically small subset of other consumers; for instance, those she is connected to via an underlying social or business network. The extent and density of clustering in the network, as well as information access, becomes strategic in technology adoption and pricing choices. 
  
* Demand-Side Network Effects and Critical Mass 
    * Businesses tend to be most familiar with increasing returns created by supply-side-driven scale economies. On the supply side of Figure 2-1, the cost curve shows that as a manufacturing company increases its output, its marginal and average unit costs decline to a point. On the supply side, the curve tracks average cost per unit as it varies with output production or scale. As average unit costs decline, the difference between revenue and costs increases, creating growing returns and increasing profit- ability over time until the cost curve stops its decline. 
  
* By contrast, networks are characterized by demand-side scale economies. 
    * The demand side of Figure 2-1 has a vertical y-axis of willingness to pay and a horizontal x-axis of number of users. Once a network has passed the critical mass point on the S-curve of growth, it enters an exponential growth stage, driven by positive network effects. After the critical mass point, willingness to pay increases because the value to the users grows sharply (as described in the earlier “Exponential Growth” sidebar with Metcalfe’s Law). As value increases, revenue and the average price that users are willing to pay tend to go up.

### N-Sided Markets

Visa is often cited as an n-sided market because its credit cards connect communities of retailers, banks, and consumers. In the case of credit cards, it’s easy to see that n-sided markets unite inter- dependent communities. The whole ecosystem would fall apart if there weren’t enough of each group present to provide a critical mass. So, although some markets can operate with a small number of customers—maybe by pricing a premium amount for each additional user or customer—Visa has zero value to retailers without a critical mass of cardholders, and vice versa. We can see a cross- network effect: the more retailers that participate worldwide, the more beneficial the card is to its users. Thus, it is important to Visa to be “Everywhere you want to be”; American Express positions itself similarly with “Don’t leave home without it.”

### Look Around While Moving Forward

- Online network effects are a powerful multiplying force

  Network effects explain the rapid emergence, victories in close competitive races, and dominance of major players like Google and Facebook. They can also create opportunities for smaller projects, initially helping them reach the niches they serve and then supporting their rapid growth.

- A few active uploaders can create online critical mass and community

  Online platforms are a convenient shortcut for reaching the passionate, authentic, and interactive users—1 to 3% of the total—who can catalyze a social network and community, generating collective user value and raising average lifetime values exponentially. It’s possible to do a lot with a little in Web 2.0.

- Viral distribution and cooperative advantage can build eco- systems rapidly

  The Web provides a mechanism for letting users spread the word about their new projects, as well as for syndicating the competences they already have and recombining innovations. 
  The Web is much more than an information distribution network—it’s a place where users can talk about the new kinds of businesses that are relatively easy to assemble in this hugely productive virtual space.
