## Class 4 PPT

### Review of Class 2
* Machine Learning: The use of mathematical procedures called algorithms to analyze data.
* Machine learning is frequently used for Predictive Analytics and the model’s predictions can be represented by a score.
* We applied two key frameworks—The 4 pillars of Applied AI and the 5 components of AI systems.
* We looked at Applied AI FinTech companies MyBank, Tala and Lenddo who used machine learning for credit scoring and decisioning.
* We analyzed and practiced how to fill out an AI Data Business Model Canvas that showed the virtuous cycle. Directional arrows connected the continuous interaction between the customer data, the AI platform, improvement to the value proposition and customer experience.

### Agenda for Class 4
* In today’s class we will analyze how machine learning can be used in preventative health care.
* Traditional medical systems treat illness when people are already sick. Heart attack and covid risk calculators can help initiate preventative action by government, public and private health providers such as early screening, medication or lifestyle changes.
* We discuss InsurTech* use cases at Lemonade, Ant Financial Auto and Ping An The Good Doctor, where companies not only provide speedy insurance for reimbursement of claims but also use machine learning to prevent illness, provide more accessible medical services or dramatically improve the customer experience.
* Insurance Technology companies are an important sector of the Financial Services industry

    *  Poor talented students seeking vocational training at Ning Tang’s school
    *  Problem-students can’t afford tuition
    *  Need-speedy credit approval for tuition loan
    *  Risk—default, not paying back
    *  Reward—better-paying jobs increase likelihood of payback
    *  Proxies—grades, attendance, teacher recommendations

### Takeaways

* 4 reasons to use machine learning for credit scoring systems
* The Scorecard method explained as first step to understanding machine learning classification systems and neural nets
* The Scorecard is easy to understand and fits with our common sense and intuition. It is “explainable” or “white-box”.
* FICO Fair Isaacs Corporation bank credit scoring is used in the US
* FinTech and alternative data credit scoring to the rescue, e.g. Lenddo.
* China uses CreditEase credit scoring for p2p loans.
* FinTech Red Unicorns like Dianrong and Ant Financial have multiple datastreams to combine.

### AI-enabled Insurance

#### Why use Machine Learning for InsurTech?

* More accurate—20-30% better performanceàbetter predictions and better at spotting claims fraud via video, e.g. Lemonade 1 min. claim
* “Unbiased”—statistical vs prejudicial biasàreduced agent favoritism or outright corruption, e.g. Ping An Medical Insurance/OneConnect
* Fast—automated decision making systemàspeeds the application and ID verification & approval process and the customer experience, e.g. Ant Financial Auto 6 seconds vs 6 days for claims reimbursement
* Cheap—predictive models work 24/7àmore accessible medical care and emergency payment for rural and underserved areas, e.g. The Good Doctor telemedicine one-minute clinic.

### Takeaways

* More accurate—20-30% better performanceàbetter predictions and better at spotting claims fraud via video, e.g. Lemonade 1 min. claim
* “Unbiased”—statistical vs prejudicial biasàreduced agent favoritism or outright corruption, e.g. Ping An Medical Insurance/OneConnect

###  Ethical Considerations

#### Assessing the risk of an automated decision making system
* Beneficiary. Who is going to gain from the decision being made? High benefits for the decisionmaker and low benefits for the individual impacted creates a high risk/unbalanced situation.
* Data Immutability. If decisions are made on the basis of characteristics people are born with such as age and ethnic origin, this is higher risk and more controversial than lifestyle choices such as the music people like or what they watch on TV.
* Impact. What effect is a decision going to have? A life or death decision about cancer treatment is much more important than whether or not to send someone a 10% coupon for frozen pizza.

#### If a company uses predictive models for “high risk” decisions then they should...
* Try to identify at risk groups. Then separate score distribution reports can be compared to see if certain groups will be adversely treated.
* For lower than average scoring groups, constraints and over-ride rules as well as different cut-offs can be set. This should allow a more fair treatment.
* Continue to monitor the situation once the decision making system goes live. Review score profile and decision rules for key groups. Fine tune cut-offs, constraints and over-rides.

#### InsurTech: Axa $10k Large-loss claims

6:25 to 9:20

#### Ethical considerations for Axa

* What are the automated decision rules that will use the predictions of the large-claim predictive model?
* Who might be at-risk groups?
* What constraints, over-ride, cut-offs should be set for risk groups?
* How to monitor?
* How to protect reputation if the large-claim predictive model is used to “screen out” undesirable drivers?

#### Different legislative regimes...
* US Utilitarian approach
    * Personal data can be harvested for business goals.
    * If there is a problem using a specific type of data, unacceptable bias against a specific group, legislation is enacted to address that concern.
* European Union rights based approach
    * Personal ownership of data. Companies have no right to hold or use personal data unless the individual gives permission.
    * GDPR General Data Protection Regulations for EU citizens and transactions. “right to erase”

### Takeaways
* We highlighted 3 areas of risk for automated decision making rules
* Companies using predictive models have the ethical responsibility for assessing if they have “high risk” automated decision-rules. If so, they need to analyze groups that might be adversely impacted.
* Companies must actively monitor these risk groups.
* The US, EU and China have very different regulatory “regimes’ .

## Class 4 Details

### Machine Learning, Heart Attack Risk Calculator Scorecards, InsurTech and Ethical Considerations
This recorded session, we will continue to deepen our understanding of Applied AI by reviewing Chapters 4-7, “explainable” or “white-box” heart attack risk linear scorecards and analyze several use cases in AI enabled insurance or InsurTech, a very “hot” and profitable area of AI FinTech in the US, Europe and Asia. This background will allow us to better analyze the ethical considerations (Chapter 12) and risks of automated decision-making, especially in medical and insurtech-related areas.

### Key Questions
* How is machine learning used to create “scores” and scorecards like the heart attack risk calculator? How much data is required for the development sample and the validation sample in the scorecard of Figure 2?
* Could you easily explain to someone else, why John is at a higher risk of heart attack than Priscilla?
* How can a predictive model help make decisions and even automate decision rules and screening for government, public and private health providers? Could you easily explain to someone else, why John should receive a covid-19 vaccine before Priscilla on the basis of the “revised” score distribution table? (My Covid fatality “revision” is for illustrative purposes only, and is not a data-validated scorecard)
* What are two credit-scoring systems, one used by US credit-reporting bureaus and the other one used by a well-known Chinese P2P lender?
* How has machine learning and alternative data at FinTech Red Unicorns Dianrong and Sesame Credit “disrupted” the previous credit-scoring system? How does the data at Ant Financial’s Sesame Credit compare in Velocity, Variety and Volume to the data used by CreditEase?
* What machine-learning benefits have InsurTech companies provided in the use cases discussed?
* What are the three areas of “Ethical Risk” for automated decision making? How can companies mitigate or manage these high risk areas?

### Learning Objectives

* Practice using a data-validated machine learning scorecard to assess and predict risks—of medical events like heart attack or covid-19 fatality or default or nonpayment of a loan.
* Learn how machine learning scores are used for automated decision making.
* Understand the risks and benefits of automated decision making
* Analyze the high ethical risk areas and groups of automated decision making and practice developing mitigating or management techniques.
* Consider the different regulatory and legal regimes and norms of different regions—US, EU and China—impacting individuals and businesses.
