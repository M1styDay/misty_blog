# Data Applications: Enterprise
This chapter will analyze the application of data commercialization in enterprises from the perspectives of large enterprises as well as small/medium-sized enterprises. There are two development trends in the future: vertical integration of industry and enterprise boundary broadening.

Before we get into this section, let's talk about the flywheel effect. The essence of the flywheel effect is to produce motion properties. Once a huge flywheel wants to turn, it needs a vast source of power. Although the beginning is tough, once it starts, the rotation will only get faster and faster. It is where the inertia of the flywheel effect lies. After reaching a certain critical point, the flywheel's gravity and momentum also become part of the driving force.

The same as flywheel, an enterprise needs to find their own interfaces and resources on the whole platform and complete the benefit integration with resource inertia.

## Large companies: Establish a Data Closed-loop Ecological Chain
Large companies are now trying to develop digital products and services for business and management. Such large companies have sufficient data sources, data storage capacity, and data processing capacity. But most companies are still in the exploratory stage of how to integrate data types, analyze data streams, and deal with massive amounts of data. Take the case of Apple Company to illustrate how large enterprises establish data closed-loop ecological chain and the value and significance of doing so.

### 1. Emergence of the concept of data closed-loop ecological chain

The formation of the concept of data closed-loop ecological chain in Apple started with the iPod and iTunes.

The physical nature of the iPod is a portable music player. It became the starting point for the rise of Apple's digital concept because of its inherent data significance. It starts with the ease of use (for example, eliminating hard barriers such as P2P software, CD burning, and recorder operation), and uses the acquired Rio team (music management program team) to simplify the product with harsh requirements and emphasize the user experience.

iTunes is apple's landmark 1.0 version of the music data platform. Apple collects the data on the iPod and consolidates it on iTunes. Apple puts data integration in front of terminal products as strategic construction so that terminal experience is well grafted on the data.

The core concept is iTunes music data integration, focussing on the organization of individual musicians. Every musician can go to any corner of the world covered by Apple with the help of this platform as long as Apple comes forward to solve the copyright and distribution problems. It is an extremely favourable condition. Users can buy their favourite songs on the platform. These pieces of user-organized music data are shelved in a "playlist," a highly personal setting that allows everyone to participate in the process of building and integrating big data.

### 2. Transform of the data collection carrier

After the emergence of a complete set of data profit closing mechanism established by iTunes and presented by iPod as physical presentation. Apple has moved the digital vehicle to the iPhone.

If iTunes triggered the flywheel, the iPhone turns the wheel completely. The reason is that the diversity of data that can be displayed on mobile phones goes far beyond music alone. Apple extended its ability to integrate data fragments into apps, transforming the music store into an app store. The world's online data is run and managed simultaneously through the iTunes platform.

At this stage, the combination of iTunes and iPhone lays a foreshadow for Apple to build a comprehensive digital platform, change the pattern of Internet enterprises and even change the way of human life.

### 3. Open access to application development

In March 2008, Apple released the application development packet for iPhone, which is another industrial revolution for big data. Apple further expanded the flywheel of big data by opening access to application development. For Apple, whose products and technologies have always been closed-loop, the size of the flywheel of big data directly determines the market size of Apple on the premise that the rotation of the flywheel is irreversible.

Therefore, the open third-party platform has brought about significant changes in the entire industrial structure. In the data content manufacturing industry, Apple, as the third party and the largest platform owner, only needs to solve the problem of profit distribution. Apple offers a 3:7 payment ratio, which internet application developers need only accept in order to launch their products in the App Store. The revenue-sharing ratio was recently updated.

At this stage, a huge digital fragmentation market was formed, with iPhone as an information receiver. Apple officially moves toward enterprise data, builds enterprise data platform, and forms a brand-new business pattern.

### 4. A new way to integrate fragmented data

When the iPad comes out, a series of Apple terminal products are faced with a new data problem: how can users collect and record behavioural data and content data more effectively? Like photos, contacts, music playlists, etc.?

iCloud integrates and combs the data industry revolution triggered by iTunes from 2000. It uses multiple data sources to collect data but establishes a big data centre through unified storage and index functions.

The essence of the data centre is still to upgrade further and process all the fragmented information relying on the Apple platform to form a new round of data integration. The appearance of iCloud indicates that Apple has completed a complete closed big data industry chain.

### 5. A win-win-win big data closed-loop ecological chain

#### User -- Product Ecosystem

With only one Apple ID, apps can be used on several devices, from the migration of users' historical usage data to the configuration environment for users' usage habits. In this process, users gradually become dependent on Apple products, forming an "ecosystem". For Apple, it's a closed-loop of data, and it's a great experience for users.

Among the consumer electronic products, Apple, Microsoft, Huawei and Xiaomi have been working hard to build this model. Colloquially, this is another form of "monopoly". However, few users see this as a "monopoly" and are more focused on a better experience.

#### Developers -- Creative Inspiration

The App Store captures the most critical needs of developers. It eliminates the cold start barrier for iPhone App development. After the development, developers do not need to pay any upfront fees to launch on the App Store, which can be immediately seen by users. If the quality is good enough, they can also get recommended by Apple and get free publicity.

Developers can set their own prices, circumvent carrier restrictions, and go directly to consumers. Developers do not have to worry about encryption mechanisms, payment methods, cyberspace, infrastructure -- the App Store takes care of everything. Just join the development plan and accept the share. On November 18, Apple announced that the commission rate for developers on the Apple App Store was lowering from 30% to 15%. (But only small businesses or independent developers with less than $1 million in annual revenue are eligible. The preferential policy will start on January 1, 2021.)

#### Companies -- a Virtuous Circle

**A virtuous cycle of users.** Since the iPod Touch was launched in 2007, Apple had been building up a loyal customer base willing to pay for Apple's service. After the launch of AppStore, the Apple ecosystem (see User -- Product ecosystem for details) has been formed, which has enhanced user stickiness. Generally speaking, it means that Apple's fan base has gradually grown, and apple's product radiation population has grown.

**A virtuous cycle of data.** In the era of digital economy, Apple invests a lot in getting users and building platforms in the early stage of development. After the actual operation, the marginal cost of business expansion is very low because of the reproducibility and easy dissemination of data. Besides, the universal type of data is powerful, giving full play to the advantages of the digital economy and producing the Matthew effect. The good use of the data and development make the company better adjust development strategy, to form the virtuous cycle, achieving a tripartite win-win situation(Voytek, 2016).

## Small and Medium-sized Companies: Cooperate with Professional Data Processors
Small/medium-sized companies also have the necessity of using data for development, but they are lack of methods and channel for data collection. Therefore, professional data processors make use of data which is collected, packaged, sampled and sorted by large enterprises to formulate data generalization collection standards and research methods and models for data analysis and mining. Eventually, data is utilized by small and medium enterprises to provide strategic support.

There are a variety of derivative applications of big data assets in small and medium-sized enterprises. For example, using the data platform to output the human resource function data of the enterprise, and setting the pain point mechanism in the performance assessment of enterprise management. Using data platform to output a large number of benchmarking cases, using the longitudinal time to complete the enterprise benchmarking problem hypothesis and solution diagnostic verification.

With the increasing demand for data, professional data processors like consulting companies often benefit from the consulting cases of modern enterprises. For consulting companies, especially consulting giants such as McKinsey, Bain and Roland Berger, they get a lot of data from their corporate strategy and cultural consulting cases every year. It includes common data of enterprise operation, data of human resource KPI, and basic data of capital operation status. In short, consulting data that can be quantified throughout the enterprise will be collected, packaged, sampled and sorted by consulting companies. Large-scale and highly managed data resources can be explored in depth through data mining techniques for integrated data.

So, take back to the flywheel effect. For small and medium-sized enterprises, the premise of flywheel rotation is the whole business environment, forming a normalized data integration and collection idea. Based on the experience of data collection, integration and mining in large enterprises, the methodology of big data asset value mining is generalized.

For small/medium enterprises, the flywheel rotation mode needs to be coordinated with the professional data processors. The specific pattern is the popularization of basic concepts of big data -- generation of big data collection and mining methodology -- consulting products and analysis models of big data asset-based processing -- updating and iteration. Any industry that adopts standardized data collection and management can be integrated by data management and effective fragmentation, and finally turn the industry flywheel, and generate colossal industry driving force. It is the precursor of vertical integration of industries and the expansion of external boundaries of enterprises.

## Vertical Integration of Industries

Industrial integration refers to the adjustment of production factors in enterprises and the construction of new capital organizations in order to seek long-term competitive advantages. The ultimate purpose is to form the dominant industry and the corresponding industrial structure with large enterprises and enterprise groups as the core. The result of vertical integration is enterprise ecological reconstruction.

Industrial integration includes horizontal integration, vertical integration and mixed integration. Horizontal industrial integration refers to the merger and reorganization of multiple enterprises in a certain link of the industrial chain. Vertical integration refers to the merger and reorganization of enterprises in the upper, middle and lower links of the industrial chain.

In the development process of the industrial chain, a large number of similar competitors will appear at each end of the industrial chain. Competitors in almost similar products and suppliers continue to improve product quality and reduce costs, in the supply chain port to complete the market occupy and market monopoly. After the completion of such industry core competition, horizontal integration has gradually been unable to meet the appetite of these enterprises. Vertical integration of enterprises has become a future trend.

Vertical integration is mainly reflected in the monopoly of the core components and the occupation of the upper and lower ends of the supply chain. For the core components, the restrictions on monopolistic resources and key technologies are strengthened. For example, Chinese computer firms, no matter how big a market they occupies, have always been domained by Intel in chips and Microsoft in operating systems. For the industrial chain, by penetrating into other ports of the supply chain, the downstream or upstream supply chain is occupied with means of capital, technology, policy, strategy and other core means. Take Xiaomi as an example. By operating the fan base and allowing users to participate in the product design process as a business strategy, xiaomi has achieved the construction of the ecological chain from Xiaomi mobile phone to xiaomi smart home.

Therefore, for large enterprises, the trend of vertical integration within the industry is inevitable. As The Internet technology, especially the development of big data capability, the main focus of the industrial chain still return to consumers.

## Industrial Boundary Broadening

In big data era, the external boundary of enterprises has become fuzzier due to the adoption of digitized language, as enterprises have adopted digitized presentation methods. To be more specific, there is no common acknowledged enterprise language between different industries and there is no possibility of a universal procedure. Through the data interface, the continuous expansion of the external boundary of the industry can enable enterprises to face the same organizational goal -- consumers.

If all industry ports eventually start with the consumer, then the enterprise will be closer to the needs of the market. Using data as a common language, the broader the data platform and data Shared by an enterprise, the more obvious the final data will be. After the arrival of the big data era, large enterprises that establish platforms will make use of their existing historical resources, the same language and final strategic orientation. Their external boundaries will be broken little by little, and finally achieve the data-based integration and sharing.

In the form of free voluntary, the enterprise's core data and can be shared or outsourced to non-specific (and usually large) public network. Relying on the core processing capacity of big data, it will open up new market resources based on big data.
