* Industries in the stages of Maturity and Decline will often seek government intervention or subsidies to help protect the declining industry. Often substitutes using innovation or new technology are the root cause of decline.
* Blue Ocean Strategy, sometimes called Value Innovation provides a new approach to managing mature or declining industries.

### Blue Ocean Strategy

#### Red Oceans vs. Blue Oceans

* Red Oceans
    * Compete in existing market
    * Shark-infested waters
    * Cutthroat competition
    * Limited market share
    * Price cutting and product commoditization
    * Differentiation or low cost

* Blue Oceans
    * Create vast new market
    * Make competition irrelevant
    * Create new demand
    * Convert non-users for growth
    * Dual advantage through value innovation
    * Differentiation and low cost

#### The Blue Ocean Shift

## Class 5 Details

### Blue Ocean Strategy
This week, we turn to Blue Ocean Strategy or Value Innovation Analysis, a framework developed by INSEAD France professors. We explain the industry life- cycle and how the five stages are characterized by different combinations of five forces. We view that it is quite challenging to be profitable in a mature industry, called a Red Ocean, but the Blue Ocean Strategy provides a systematic approach to transforming a Red Ocean into a Blue Ocean. We explain and then apply the Four- Action Process to the Circus industry, the US Budget Wine Industry and finally, the commuter bike industry. Finally, we practice our new value innovation skills in adjusting our business decisions after seeing the results of our Q2 test market in the Simulation Game.

### Key Questions

1. What is the industry life cycle and what combination of five-forces characterize each of the phases?
2. What is a red ocean and which phases of the industry life cycle are most likely to be red oceans?
3. What is a blue ocean and what are the characteristics compared to a red ocean?
4. What is the Four Action process for a Blue Ocean shift and how can you apply it?


### Learning Objectives

* Know the Blue Ocean Four-Action process of value innovation and when and how to apply to transform red ocean competition and industry structure.
* Think and be comfortable explaining how value innovation was applied in the circus, wine and commuter bike industries to transform those Red Oceans.
* Speak up in the discussions and consider if value innovation can be applied to your company simulation game.
* Act and practice applying Four-Action value innovation concepts in your exercises, discussion questions and simulation game executive decision- making.
