## Class 7 Details

### New Venture Funding and AI Startups

This week, we turn to New Venture Funding and AI Startups from the VC Perspective. We explain how the lean startup methodology, combined with the business model canvas was used by Steve Blank in his Lean Launchpad Class at Stanford. We discuss forming a team with complementary skills. Then we follow one Stanford venture as it progresses through the Lean Launchpad Class 10 week session, starting with an initial idea that needed two major pivots before attracting partners, achieving market product fit and finding venture capital funding.

We then turn to seed capital and accelerators, focusing on the well-known YCombinator and why it has been so successful. We provide some self-test quizzes, 7A and 7B. In the second part of the recorded session, we gain a VC perspective on applied AI startups and the milestones that they must meet to get funding. This is a review of the article, “Age of Intelligent Software”, and highlights the funding and success of Affirm, a FinTech startup offering installment payment loans online.

Finally, we look at tips for AI startups and projects and the “elevator pitch” used.
