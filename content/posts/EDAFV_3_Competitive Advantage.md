## Class 3 PPT

### Competitive Advantage Defined

#### Startegy Toolbox

* Firm-level Analysis
* Industry-level Analysis
    * Competitive Advantage Analysis
    * Value Chain Analysis

#### Level of Analysis: One Company vs. Industry

* Industry = Many Companies
* Industry = Companies that make simliar products or services
* Market = Many Buysers
* Market = Buyers of an industry’s products and services, ex. the commuter who needs a recreation bike for transport to work...

#### Industry Average Profitability

* Add up the total profit of companies in industry Profit of Company 
    * 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = $
* Divide the Total profit by number of companies in industry 
    * Total profit / 5 = $
* For profit margin, calculate the total profit as a percentage of total industry revenue
    * Total profit/ Total revenue of company 1+2+3+4+5.

#### Porter’s Competitive Advantage

* Porter’s Competitive Advantage = Company with above average industry profitability

#### Takeawasys

* Competitive advantage analysis requires “zooming out” to industry-level analysis, looking at the forest as well as the trees.
* Industries are groups of companies that make similar products or services.
* Markets are groups of customers that buy products or services
* Competitive advantage and industry performance is measured just like grades in a classroom with low, high and average performers.
* Financial industries and FinTech (Financial + Technology companies) tend to have higher average profitability than others
* A company has a competitive advantage in its industry when it has above average industry profitability.


### Competitive Strategy & Value Chain Analysis

#### Value Chain Analysis

* How do you implement a differentiation or low-cost strategy? By analyzing and developing a unique combination of activities in the value chain

* Show the key activities that add value to a product in this industry by filling out the industry value chain template.
* Include the typical activities that are performed in the value chain by many of the industry’s competitors since these highlight the dominant way companies have competed in the industry.
* Find the price drivers, those activities that have a big impact on differentiation and the willingness of customers to pay a premium price.
* Find the cost drivers, those activities that have a big impact on costs.
* Develop a unique combination of activities and value proposition to achieve competitive advantage through differentiation or by lowering your cost basis.

#### Example

* Step 1: Road bike industry value chain
* Step 2: Compare to well-known industry competitor and brandname

* Step 3: What are price drivers? (green)
* Step 4: What are cost drivers? (yellow)

* The five key steps to value chain analysis include diagramming the dominant industry value chain, identifying price and cost drivers and choosing a unique combination of value chain activities.
* Choice of channel—retail stores or e-commerce/direct to consumer impacts profitability.
* AI can help in personalization & increasing customer data stream and experience, i.e. customized fitting

## Class 3 Details

### Competitive Advantage and Profitability Analysis
This zoom session, we focus on competitive advantage and how to achieve above- average profitability in your industry.

In the previous zoom session we were focused on the Lean Startup Approach and formed startup teams to get the “hands-on” experience of being executive-level co- founders of a high tech bicycle company, naming the company and making the key Q1 decisions of the company’s priority target customers (recreation, mountain or speed bike buyers), setting up sales offices and production. The mission statement formulated was based on company or firm-level goals and estimated revenues, costs and profits calculated with broad assumptions and existing market survey results.

We now move from firm-level analysis to industry-level analysis to understand what is “competitive advantage” and how this performance is measured in corporate and business strategy classes in business school. Although, common everyday usage of the term “competitive advantage” is very vague, “a condition or circumstance that puts a company in a favorable or superior business position...”, investment and business definition of the term is very precise, measurable and actionable.

We then discuss profit margins in three “generic” strategies for competitive advantage—low-cost, differentiated and dual advantage. We deepen this analysis by comparing the value chain analysis and profitability of two bicycle companies— Trek, a traditional bike producer who was one of the early mountain bike producers in the US and Dragon, an upstart online high end speed bike startup with an innovative applied AI approach.

Before breaking up into 1 hour of zoom team breakout session to review the results of Q1 decisions and discuss the Q2 test market decisions to be submitted, we will review how your team can apply value chain analysis and industry profitability analysis to your simulation game decisions and market research results.
During the following recorded session, Class 4, we will continue to deepen our understanding of Applied AI by reviewing Chapters 4-7, “explainable” heart attack risk scorecards and analyze several use cases in AI enabled insurance or InsurTech, a very “hot” and profitable area of AI FinTech in the US, Europe and Asia. This background will allow us to better analyze the ethical considerations (Chapter 12) and risks of automated decision-making, especially in medical and insurtech-related areas.

### Key questions

* What is firm-level vs industry-level strategic analysis? Why is it necessary to “zoom in” and “zoom out” in strategic thinking for your startup?
* What is the business definition of “competitive advantage” and how is it measured and calculated within an industry?
* How does the industry-level definition of “competitive advantage” make the two main strategies for achieving advantage clear-cut?
* How does industry profitability analysis help startups decide on profit and services?
* How does industry-level value chain analysis help startups with firm-level decisions on technology, channel, pricing, branding, marketing, operations?
* What assumptions and hypotheses do you need to test in a test market where you know there will be a number of other bicycle startup companies with similar technology? How do you think competition will impact your market share and/or profitability?
* How quickly can you scale your bicycle business? How many bicycles can a new sales person in a newly opened sales office sell each quarter? How quickly will your marketing and advertising spend build up demand in a new city? How flexible is your manufacturing production to meet higher or lower than forecast demand?

### Learning Objectives

* Learn to “zoom in” and “zoom out” in strategic thinking with firm-level and industry-level strategic analysis tools.
* Learn how to calculate above-average and below-average industry profitability.
* Review the average industry profitability of different industries and compare the financial industry and FinTech with the trucking or newspaper industry.
* Analyze the “competitive advantage” and “value chain” of two companies in the bicycle industry—Trek and Dragon.
* Apply these new competitive analysis tools to your company in formulating your Q2 business decisions and your Go-To-Test-Market approach.
* Practice the Lean Startup Methodology:
    * Hypothesis: Here’s What we Thought (captured on the BMC)Q
    * Experiment: So Here’s What We Did (Q1 & Q2 Business Decisions) o Results: So Here’s What We Found (Sales, Share, Profits Performance)
    * Iterate: So Here’s What We Are Going to Do Next (Adjustments,Pivots)
