#### Alexa Voice Engine & Applied AI Services

6-pager business plan at 2011 Bezos strategy meeting: “A low-cost, ubiquitous computer with all its brains in the
cloud that you could interact with over voice—you speak to it, it speaks to you,” 

--as described by Al Lindsay, project lead, in “Inside Amazon’s AI flywheel” Wired Magazine, 

Far-field {voice recognition} technology had been done before... But “it was on the nose cone of Trident submarines, and it cost a billion dollars.” Amazon was trying to implement it in a device that would sit on a kitchen counter, and it had to be cheap enough for consumers to spring for a weird new gadget. 

--as described by Limp, the VP of devices and services in “Inside Amazon’s AI flywheel”. Echo Dot available 2015...and becomes fastest adoption consumer product in 3 years time.

#### Amazon Echo Voice Engine & Assistant

Core Components of most AI/ML applications p.11:
* Data input-camera image, voice, text, forms? Voice Example: Alexa, tell me the weather in SF...
* Data (pre)processing? DL for soundbites & NLP
* Predictive models- Far field voice recognition + understanding of intent and context of voice question or command.
* Decision Rules (rule sets)—Use the appropriate Alexa skill to address user intent...
* Response/output-Alexa voice response...

### Takeaways

* Applied AI products and services in all industries and markets were accelerated by two core AI deep learning technologies—image and voice recognition
* The key AI crossover point and date for commercialization and rapid user adoption is at the 95% human accuracy level.
* We discussed applications in self-driving cars, rapid adoption to 50% of Amazon Alexa (Echo Dot) voice speakers and the emergence of voice-enabled devices including smart kitchen appliances.

#### Deep Learning

* The more the layers, the “deeper” the network.
* Convoluted Neural Network: Not connecting all inputs to all of the neurons in the first layer.
* Recurrent Neural Network: Create feedback loops where the output of later layers act as inputs to earlier layers. Time latency effect.
* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Semi-supervised learning
* Reinforcement Learning

### White Box & Black Box AI

#### Create a common sense baseline first...

#### The Ethics of Applied AI & Deep Learning

* What can you do with AI?
* What should you do with AI?

## Class 6 Details

### Deep Learning and Neural Networks

This week, we turn to Deep Learning and Neural Networks. We explain how two recent “core” or “fundamental” AI research advances turned out to be breakthroughs –in image and voice recognition--that opened up a world of commercial opportunity and applied AI
products and services. We note that Fei-Fei Li, a Chinese-American woman computer science professor saw that AI advances in deep learning were stuck without better datasets and created ImageNet, the catalyst for the AI boom in image recognition . We look at the AI vs human speech recognition crossover and the business impact on accelerating the fastest growing consumer product in history and consider the new directions future products and services will take. We review artificial neurons, neural networks, supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning before discussing white-box and black box AI.

Since this is such an important area to understand, I recommend taking a look at the optional videos and readings in the areas that interest you the most.

### Key Questions

* What are the two core AI breakthroughs and when did they happen?
* What is an artificial neuron & neural network?
* What is deep learning and how many layers of a neural network is deep?
* What is supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning? 
* Why does white box and black box AI matter to your choice of AI system?

### Learning Objectives

* Know the two core AI breakthroughs and how we measure the crossover point and timeframe. Note how quickly consumer adoption followed
* Think and be comfortable explaining deep learning and a simple example of supervised vs unsupervised machine learning.
* Speak up in the discussions and consider how white box and black box AI differ and why this might have legal or ethical implications for automated decision-making
* Act and practice applying two key and equally important questions to AI projects and ideas—Can we do this with AI? And, should we do this with AI?
