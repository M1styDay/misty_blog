### AI FinTech and how AI can help alleviate poverty？

#### Smart Loans risks
* Globally 1.7B adults are unbanked & do not have access to a bank loan...

* MSME=Micro, Small and Medium Sized Businesses/Enterprises

* Without access to loans and with little or no savings, MSMEs are at-risk...
    * They cannot plan and pay for regular expenses like family schooling, water, electricity
    * An unexpected illness, medical expense, death in family, natural disaster can ruin their micro- business or make them homeless.
    * They cannot break out of their cycle of poverty
    * Loan from non-bank entities have extremely high interest rates—300%, e.g.

## Class 2 Details

### Applied AI in Business
In this recorded session, we start with a big picture perspective on Applied vs Core AI Technology and how recent breakthroughs in two key areas have transformed the commercial product opportunities in many industries. 

We introduce the 4 pillars of Applied AI* and machine learning:
1. Virtual assistance such as chatbots
2. Generating insights from AI-enabled data collection and analysis
3. Automating manual processes such as form-filling, data entry or routine
4. Unlocking Unstructured Data

We will discuss and analyze the simple example of the “robot lawyer” AI-enabled DoNotPay mobile app and startup created by an incoming Stanford freshman student, looking at the 5 components of the DoNotPay chatbot system, the key questions asked by the chatbot and the If/Then flowchart.

Finally we will use our framework and AI data Business Model Canvas to analyze the AI enabled FinTech (Financial Technology) use cases at MyBank, Tala and Lenddo.

The Four Pillars of AI framework was developed from the 2016 Forbes article on “Four Ways Every Business Needs to Use Artificial Intelligence” by Greg Satell. Here’s a link to the original article. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregsatell/2016/09/18/4-ways-every-business-needs-to-use-artificial-intelligence/?sh=1a16b9bf2a52

### Key Questions
* How did the robot lawyer DoNotPay use AI and machine learning? Did it use all of the abovementioned “4 ways to use AI in business” or not? Was it “successful” and why, or why not?
* What were the 5 components of the DoNotPay AI system?
* How would you fill out a Business Model Canvas for DoNotPay?
* How can you show the dynamic interaction of an AI mobile platform--generating insights, unlocking unstructured data and improved customer value and experience--on a Business Model Canvas. Does the use of directional arrows help highlight the movement and speed of the “virtuous loop”?

### Learning Objectives

Introduce a Four Pillars of AI framework we will use for identifying the four ways that AI should be used and applied in every business.

Practice applying this framework to simple AI-enabled chatbot systems like the DoNotPay mobile app.

* Analyze the four ways AI was used in this app.
* Analyze the 5 components of the AI system.
* Fill out a Business Model Canvas for an AI-enabled startup like DoNotPay
* Show how the boxes of the AI Data Business Model Canvas “interact” as a “virtuous loop” in an AI-data mobile platform through the use of circular directional arrows.

In the problem set, we practice applying this AI Data Business Model Canvas framework to three AI-enabled FinTech companies—MyBank, Tala and Lenddo.
